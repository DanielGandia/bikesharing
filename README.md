# Bike-Sharing Analysis and Visualization

## Overview of the Analysis:

The client has requested an additional story in Tableau Public to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

Part of the request is to create vizualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Resources:

- Data Sources: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, 201908-citibike-tripdata_updated.csv
- Software: Tableau Public 2021.1.1, Visual Studio Code 1.54, Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4

## Results:

### The following images are based on the NYC Bikesharing analysis and data:

Visualization #1: The below image shows the busiest times of the day in order to be able to make an assessment if repairs are needed on the bikes.

Visualization #2: The below image shows the top locations where users take bikes and start their trip.

Visualization #3: The below image shows that the vast majority of trips are from users who use them for short term trips.

Visualization #4: The below image shows most male users are on bikes for a short period of time.

Visualization #5: The below image shows the peak time during the week for the usage of the bikes occurs on the evening of Mondays, Tuesday and Thursday from 5:00pm to 7:00pm.

Visualization #6: The below image shows, similar to Visualization #4, male users are on bikes during the peak times of the day.

Visualization #7: The below image shows male subscribers have the majority of the usage of the bikes.

Visualization #8: The below image is a dashboard of the previous 5 requested visualizations.

## Summary

By using the above shown visualizations, it can be determined that Des Moines could use a bike sharing program in their high trafficked areas. The main goal would have to find areas around the city that would be best enjoyed while riding a bike. Create tour routes with points of interests in order to influnce potential users to become riders. Based on the visualizations, male enjoy shorter trips while females cruise for a longer time. Also, create a subscriber program with additional benefits and discounts to encourage users to join. Weekends tend to be high usage days and repairs should be made prior to the weekends.

Some additional visualizations that could be beneficial for future references could be:

- Bike utilization per Birth Year, to understand the demographic that is using the bikes most often and market accordingly.

- Most frequently used start station name, to see if expansions are needed based on the amount of bikes and the demand of usage per station.
